        <div class="title">Aircraft Incidents by Flight Phase:</div>
        All that has been discussed above can sometimes be out of your control, so here's some data that works for every plane regardless of the previous criteria: flight phases. While you may need to do some search on what each phase means, knowing what phase incident happens the most can be helpful when you fly. From our data, Takeoff and Taxi seems to have the most incidents, while maneuvering, go-around, and climb have the least incidents.<br></br>
